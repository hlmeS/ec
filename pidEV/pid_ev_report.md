# PID-Tuning using Evolutionary Computation

## Abstract

## Motivation

PID (Proportional, Integral, Derivative) Controllers are a common type of control algorithm for dynamic systems, given its well-known form, simplicity when compared to modern algorithms and wide range of applications; that is, about 90% of the industry still uses PID controllers [3]. Yet, despite its well-known form, the tuning of a PID controller may seem daunting when the behavior of the dynamic system is not known and difficult to estimate, and when the external conditions vary from those experienced during the tuning process. A variety of PID-tuning approaches have been proposed and implemented, one being the Generic Algorithm (GA) approach that is also considered for this mini project.

Bridging the disciplines of evolutionary computation and control engineering, this project attempts the tuning of a PID-controller for a mass-spring-damper system, i.e. the text book example for the introduction to control theory.
